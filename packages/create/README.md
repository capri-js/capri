# Create Capri 🌱

The easiest way to get started with Capri is by using `@capri-js/create`. This CLI tool enables you to quickly start building a new Capri site, with everything set up for you. You can create a new site using the default template, or by using one of the [official examples](https://github.com/capri-js/capri/tree/main/examples). To get started, use the following command:

```bash
npm init capri
# or
yarn create capri
```

To create a new project in a specific folder, you can pass a name as argument

```bash
npm init capri -- my-capri-site
# or
yarn create capri my-capri-site
```
