Here is some text about a certain digimon:</p><div>A tiny Baby Digimon wearing a metallic helmet. Within the two horns attached to its helmet, it has antennae that are able to receive any radio wave or sound. Caprimon is in possession of bat-like traits, as it has weak eyesight, and produces ultrasonic waves from its mouth, recognizing the objects ahead of it from the rebounding sound wave. For that reason, Caprimon is able to act irrespective of day or night. Its technique is generating a resonance between its two horns (Howling Hertz). If they suffer this technique, even a large Digimon will be completely paralyzed.</div><a href="/capri/react/">Home</a></main></div>
